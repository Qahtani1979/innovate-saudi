# Phase 1: Pre-Planning Strategic Methodology
## Complete Guide for Municipal Innovation Strategy Leaders

---

## Executive Summary

Phase 1 (Pre-Planning) is the **intelligence gathering and foundation-building phase** that determines the quality and relevance of the entire strategic plan. As a strategy leader, your role is to systematically collect, analyze, and synthesize information that will inform strategic decision-making.

**Duration:** 4-8 weeks depending on municipality size
**Key Outcome:** Comprehensive situational awareness and strategic readiness

---

## ✅ IMPLEMENTATION STATUS: FULLY CONNECTED (100%)

Phase 1 components are **100% complete** (6 UI components + 6 DB tables + 6 hooks).

**✅ RESOLVED (2025-12-14):** Phase 1 data is now automatically fed into Phase 2 (Strategy Creation) via `useStrategyContext` hook, and Phase 3 (Cascade) via the strategy tracking fields.

The following Phase 1 data is aggregated and used in strategy creation:
- **PESTLE Factors**: Environmental scan data with opportunities/threats
- **SWOT Analysis**: Strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats
- **Stakeholder Analysis**: Power/interest mapping, key players
- **Risk Assessment**: Risk registry with scores and mitigations
- **Strategy Inputs**: Stakeholder feedback with sentiment analysis
- **Baseline Metrics**: KPI baselines with gap analysis

**Data Flow:** Phase 1 → `useStrategyContext` → Phase 2 (StrategicPlanBuilder, ObjectiveGenerator) → Phase 3 (Cascade Generators)

# SECTION 2: METHODOLOGIES TO APPLY

## 2.1 Environmental Analysis Methodologies

### A. PESTLE Analysis

**Purpose:** Systematic analysis of macro-environmental factors

**Process:**
1. **Identify factors** across all 6 PESTLE categories
2. **Assess impact** (High/Medium/Low) on innovation strategy
3. **Determine trend** (Increasing/Stable/Decreasing)
4. **Classify as** opportunity or threat
5. **Prioritize** based on likelihood × impact
6. **Monitor** key factors continuously

**Best Practice Tips:**
- Use a diverse team for brainstorming
- Ground factors in evidence (cite sources)
- Focus on factors relevant to innovation, not general business
- Update quarterly, not just annually
- Link PESTLE outputs to SWOT opportunities/threats

### B. Scenario Planning

**Purpose:** Prepare for multiple possible futures

**Process:**
1. **Identify key uncertainties** from PESTLE analysis
2. **Select two most impactful uncertainties** as axes
3. **Create 4 scenario quadrants**
4. **Develop narrative** for each scenario
5. **Identify strategic implications** per scenario
6. **Define early warning indicators** for each

**Example Scenarios for Municipal Innovation:**
